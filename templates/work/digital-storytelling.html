          Digital Storytelling

        <p class="work-page__title">Visit Lincoln's Chicago</p>

      <p>
        In 2011 The Chicago History Museum opened the <span class="italic">Lincoln’s Chicago</span> exhibition. The gallery features portraits of Lincoln’s contemporaries, as well as lithograph views created by artist Adolph Kurz depicting Chicago between 1861–1865.  Together, the images provide a glimpse of the city that Lincoln knew&mdash;a dynamic young metropolis on the brink of greatness.
      </p>

      <p>The Museum wants people to be excited by history, and leadership identified the exhibition experience as being too passive. They approached me to help enhance the visitor experience through technology. I teamed up with the exhibition curator, an editor, the multimedia assistant, and a flash developer to create <span class="italic">Visit Lincoln’s Chicago</span>&mdash;an interactive digital storytelling experience.</p>
      <p>
        We would know if <span class="italic">Visit Lincoln’s Chicago</span> was enhancing the visitor experience if we received positive feedback from visitors during user testing, and from anecdotal observations made by the visitor services and security staff.
      </p>


      <h3 class="work-page__subheading">My Role</h3>
      <p>
        I was the user experience lead on the team. After a curator-led exhibition walkthrough, I was struck by the idea to reframe the visitor’s perspective. Instead of standing outside looking in, we should transport the visitor inside the lithographs and send them on a time travel adventure. We would give them context, a starting point, and the freedom to drive the experience. To help bring this idea to life I co-wrote the story with the team; applied interaction design methods; and conducted usability tests.
      </p>

      <h3 class="work-page__subheading">Storytelling</h3>
      <p>
        I led four team workshops to help create the story:
      </p>

       <ul class="large-block-grid-2">
        <li><h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">1) Themes &amp; Groupings</h4>
          <p>
            We referenced the lithographs to create an affinity diagram, which generated six categories based on geography and content:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><p>The Heart of Chicago</p></li>
              <li><p>The Commercial District</p></li>
              <li><p>Cultural Attractions</p></li>
              <li><p>Waterways</p></li>
              <li><p>Churches</p></li>
              <li><p>The South Side</p></li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">2) Arc &amp; Framework</h4>
          <p>We used the themes and groupings to create the story arc:</p>
          <p class="italic">
            You journey to 1860s Chicago via train, arriving at the Great Central Depot.  Your first destination is the Sherman House, a hotel that serves as the launch pad for your visit. Stepping outside of your hotel you find a map and tour guide offering visits to several attractions that Chicago has to offer. The train is ready to bring you back to the present whenever you're ready to leave.
          </p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">3) Surprise &amp; Delight</h4>
          <p>
          I conducted an interview with the curator that revealed moments of surprise and delight in the form of curatorial trivia focused on specific and unique elements found within each lithograph.
          </p>

    <ul class="large-block-grid-3">
      <li>
        <p class="image__title">Full View</p>

        <img src="images/work/digital-storytelling/ds-courthouse-square-mask.jpg">
        <p>We highlight one of the surprising elements of the attraction and provide curatorial trivia.</p>

        <p>First introduced in 1858, horse-drawn cars run on iron tracks and move twice as fast as walking. They operate throughout Chicago’s central district but often create traffic jams.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

        <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">4) Weaving the Narrative</h4>
          <p>
            Finally, we used all of the previously generated story assets to write the narrative&mdash;which I used to create the user flow.
          </p>

      <h3 class="work-page__subheading">Interaction Design</h3>
      <p>
        I created user-flow diagrams, lo-fi wireframes, and historically accurate map markers which we used to visualize the story.
      </p>

      <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">User-Flow</h4>
      <p class="italic"> The clouds are actions taken by the user or system, and the rectangles are views.</p>

          I sketched and annotated lo-fi wireframes with the team; which we used to visualize the story, build the activity, and for spatial memory.

        <p class="work-item__title">
          I worked closely with the exhibition curator to create a photoshop file that contained a color coded system of map markers and layers to identify historically accurate attraction locations. The developer used this file to maintain the authenticity of the experience.

      <h3 class="work-page__subheading">Usability Testing</h3>
      <p>
        While the high-fidelity and functional prototype was being prepared I created the contextual usability test, the facilitator script, assigned test roles, scheduled testing, and coordinated with the Museum's exhibition team and visitor services staff to help set up our lab.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the prototype was ready, we set it up contextually in the gallery and recruited five Museum visitors to help us test. I facilitated the test, the developer and multimedia assistant recorded, and I invited the rest of the team and stakeholders to observe.
      </p>

      <ul class="large-block-grid-3">
        <li><h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">The Test Purpose</h4>
          <p>
         To identify friction points in the activity’s design as encountered by a real user in the natural environment. Specifically we were looking at navigation, readability, comprehension, and fatigue.

        <h3 class="work-page__subheading">Challenges</h3>
        <p>I experienced three major challenges while working on Visit Lincoln’s Chicago&mdash;A small budget, limiting technology, and no avenue for incremental innovation.
        </p>

        <ul class="large-block-grid-3">
        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Small Budget</h4>
          <p>
            Our budget was $25,000 total including equipment. We did the best we could with our budget, but it really limited our time with the developer, our technology options, and my vision of creating the next great history themed video game.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Limiting Technology</h4>
          <p>
            The touchscreen we used for the activity needed to stand up to the daily wear and tear inflicted by Museum visitors. To meet this requirement and stay within budget, the trade off was using a tough touchscreen that did not recognize contemporary touch gestures. We were limited to touch, press, and drag; users expected the ability to pinch close and open, unfortunately that was not an option.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">No Evolution Plan</h4>
          <p>
            Though the activity is still in use, there is no plan for enhancing, or further developing, the experience. I would love for this to become a mobile RPG presented by the Museum.
          </p>
        </li>
        </ul>
