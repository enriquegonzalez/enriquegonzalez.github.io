        In 2012 The Chicago History Museum opened an exhibition titled <span class="italic">Lincoln’s Chicago</span>. The gallery features portraits of Lincoln’s contemporaries, as well as lithograph views created by artist Adolph Kurz depicting Chicago between 1861–1865.  Together, the images provide a glimpse of the city that Lincoln knew – a dynamic young metropolis on the brink of greatness.

      <p>Leadership in the Museum identified the exhibition experience as too passive, so they approached me to help enhance the visitor experience. I teamed up with the exhibition curator, an editor, the multimedia assitant, and a flash developer to create <span class="italic">Visit Lincoln’s Chicago</span>&mdash;an interactive digital storytelling experience.</p>


      <h3 class="work-page__subheading">My Role</h3>
      <p>
        I was the User Experience lead on the team. After a curator-led exhibition walkthrough, I had the idea to reframe the visitor’s perspective. Instead of being outside looking in, we should take the visitor inside of the lithographs. Send them on a time travel adventure&mdash;give them context, a starting point, and let them drive the experience. To help bring this idea to life I co-wrote the story with the curator; performed interaction design; and conducted usability tests.

      <h3 class="work-page__subheading">Storytelling</h3>
      <p>
        I led four team workshop sessions to help create the story. During the first session I used an affinity diagram to help the team identify lithograph themes and groupings. For the second session we used the themes and groupings to create the story framework and arc. In the final session, I conducted an interview with the curator that revealed new elements of surprise and delight found in the lithographs. Finally we used all of the previously generated story assets to weave the narrative together.
