      Digital Storytelling: Visit Lincoln’s Chicago
    </h2>
    <img class="title__image" src="images/work/digital-storytelling/digital-storytelling.jpg">
  </header>

  <p>
    In 2011 The Chicago History Museum opened the <span class="italic">Lincoln’s Chicago</span> exhibition. The gallery features portraits of Lincoln’s contemporaries, as well as lithograph views created by artist Adolph Kurz depicting Chicago between 1861–1865.  Together, the images provide a glimpse of the city that Lincoln knew&mdash;a dynamic young metropolis on the brink of greatness.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Museum wants people to be excited by history, and leadership identified the exhibition experience as being too passive. They approached me to help enhance the visitor experience through technology. I teamed up with the exhibition curator, an editor, the multimedia assistant, and a flash developer to create <span class="italic">Visit Lincoln’s Chicago</span>&mdash;an interactive digital storytelling experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    We would know if <span class="italic">Visit Lincoln’s Chicago</span> was enhancing the visitor experience if we received positive feedback from visitors during user testing, and from anecdotal observations made by the visitor services and security staff.

      <h3 class="subhead subhead--large">My Role</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      I was the user experience lead on the team. After a curator-led exhibition walkthrough, I was struck by the idea to reframe the visitor’s perspective. Instead of standing outside looking in, we should transport the visitor inside the lithographs and send them on a time travel adventure. We would give them context, a starting point, and the freedom to drive the experience. To help bring this idea to life I co-wrote the story with the team; applied interaction design methods; and conducted usability tests.

      <h3 class="subhead subhead--large">Storytelling</h3>
      <p>
        I led four team workshops to help create the story.

    <ul class="large-block-grid-2">
      <li>
        <h4 class="subhead subhead--medium">1) Themes &amp; Groupings</h4>
        <p>
          We referenced the lithographs to create an affinity diagram, which generated six categories based on geography and content:
        </p>
      <ol>
        <li><p class="no-space text--small">The Heart of Chicago</p></li>
        <li><p class="no-space text--small">The Commercial District</p></li>
        <li><p class="no-space text--small">Cultural Attractions</p></li>
        <li><p class="no-space text--small">Waterways</p></li>
        <li><p class="no-space text--small">Churches</p></li>
        <li><p class="no-space text--small">The South Side</p></li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 class="subhead subhead--medium">2) Arc &amp; Framework</h4>
        <p>We used the themes and groupings to create the story arc:</p>
        <p class="italic text--small">
          You journey to 1860s Chicago via train, arriving at the Great Central Depot.  Your first destination is the Sherman House, a hotel that serves as the launch pad for your visit. Stepping outside of your hotel you find a map and tour guide offering visits to several attractions that Chicago has to offer. The train is ready to bring you back to the present whenever you're ready to leave.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      <div class="large-9 columns">
        <h4 class="subhead subhead--medium">3) Surprise &amp; Delight</h4>
        <p>
          I conducted an interview with the curator that revealed moments of surprise and delight in the form of curatorial trivia focused on specific and unique elements found within each lithograph.

        <p class="text--small">When a detail is selected&mdash;we provide curatorial trivia e.g. first introduced in 1858, horse-drawn cars operated throughout Chicago’s central district. They ran on iron tracks, and moved twice as fast as walking.</p>

          Finally, we used all of the previously generated story assets to write the narrative&mdash;which I used to create the user flow.

            I sketched and annotated lo-fi wireframes with the team. They were a fast, ugly, and effective means which we used to visualize the story. The developer used them to help build the activity, and the rest of the team used them for spatial memory.

            I worked closely with the exhibition curator to create a photoshop file that contained a color coded system of map markers and layers to identify historically accurate attraction locations. The developer used this file to maintain the authenticity of the experience.

          I created a contextual usability test, and coordinated with the Museum’s exhibition team and visitor services staff to help set up our lab in the gallery. When the prototype was ready, we recruited five Museum visitors to help us test. I facilitated the test, the developer and multimedia assistant recorded, and the rest of the team and stakeholders observed.

              We also caught several usability issues e.g. users were unaware when they completed a tour. To resolve this we added visual indicators when all attractions, and attraction details have been viewed. Specifically, a dialog note appears on completion, and tours along with tour attractions are greyed out as visited.

        <div class="large-9 columns">
          <p>
            I experienced three major challenges while working on Visit Lincoln’s Chicago&mdash;A small budget, limiting technology, and no avenue for incremental innovation.

      <li>
        <h4 class="subhead subhead--medium">Small Budget</h4>
        <p class="text--small">
          Our budget was $25,000 total, including equipment. We did the best we could with our budget, but it limited our time with the developer, our technology options, and the potential of creating the next great history themed video game.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 class="subhead subhead--medium">Limiting Technology</h4>
        <p class="text--small">
          The touchscreen we used for the activity needed to stand up to the daily wear and tear inflicted by Museum visitors. To meet this requirement and stay within budget, we compromised by implementing a touchscreen that did not recognize contemporary gestures. We were limited to touch, press, and drag; users expected the ability to pinch close and open, unfortunately that was not an option.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 class="subhead subhead--medium">No Evolution Plan</h4>
        <p class="text--small">
          Though the activity is still in use at the Museum, there is no plan for enhancing the experience. I would love for this to become a mobile RPG presented by the Museum.
