        In 2012 The Chicago History Museum opened an exhibition titled <span class="italic">Lincoln’s Chicago</span>. The gallery features portraits of Lincoln’s contemporaries, as well as lithograph views created by artist Adolph Kurz depicting Chicago between 1861–1865.  Together, the images provide a glimpse of the city that Lincoln knew – a dynamic young metropolis on the brink of greatness.
      </p>

      <p>Leadership in the Museum identified the exhibition experience as too passive, so they approached me to help enhance the visitor experience. I teamed up with the exhibition curator, an editor, the multimedia assitant, and a flash developer to create <span class="italic">Visit Lincoln’s Chicago</span>&mdash;an interactive digital storytelling experience.</p>


      <h3 class="work-page__subheading">My Role</h3>
      <p>
        I was the User Experience lead on the team. After a curator-led exhibition walkthrough, I had the idea to reframe the visitor’s perspective. Instead of being outside looking in, we should take the visitor inside of the lithographs. Send them on a time travel adventure&mdash;give them context, a starting point, and let them drive the experience. To help bring this idea to life I co-wrote the story with the curator; performed interaction design; and conducted usability tests.

      <h3 class="work-page__subheading">Storytelling</h3>
      <p>
        I led four team workshops to help create the story.

          <p class="subheading__note">LITHOGRAPH THEMES &amp; GROUPINGS</p>
          <p>
            We came up with six categories based on geography and content:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The Heart of Chicago</li>
              <li>The Commercial District</li>
              <li>Cultural Attractions</li>
              <li>Waterways</li>
              <li>Churches</li>
              <li>The South Side</li>
            </ol>

          <p class="subheading__note">STORY ARC &amp; FRAMEWORK</p>
          <p>We used the lithograph themes and groupings to come up with this framework:</p>
          <p>
            You journey to 1860s Chicago via train, arriving at the Great Central Depot.  Your first destination is the Sherman House, a hotel that serves as the launch pad for your visit. Stepping outside of your hotel you find a map and tour guide offering visits to several attractions that Chicago has to offer.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Workshop #3</h4>
          <p class="subheading__note">ELEMENTS OF SURPRISE &amp; DELIGHT</p>
          <p>I conducted an interview with the curator that revealed moments of surprise and delight in the form of curatorial trivia focused on specific elements found within each lithograph.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Workshop #4</h4>
          <p class="subheading__note">WRITE THE NARRATIVE</p>
          <p>
            Finally, we used all of the previously generated story assets to weave the narrative together.
