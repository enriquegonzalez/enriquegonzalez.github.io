        In 2011 The Chicago History Museum opened an exhibition titled <span class="italic">Lincoln’s Chicago</span>. The gallery features portraits of Lincoln’s contemporaries, as well as lithograph views created by artist Adolph Kurz depicting Chicago between 1861–1865.  Together, the images provide a glimpse of the city that Lincoln knew – a dynamic young metropolis on the brink of greatness.
      </p>

      <p>Leadership in the Museum identified the exhibition experience as too passive, so they approached me to help enhance the visitor experience. I teamed up with the exhibition curator, an editor, the multimedia assitant, and a flash developer to create <span class="italic">Visit Lincoln’s Chicago</span>&mdash;an interactive digital storytelling experience.</p>


      <h3 class="work-page__subheading">My Role</h3>
      <p>
        I was the User Experience lead on the team. After a curator-led exhibition walkthrough, I had the idea to reframe the visitor’s perspective. Instead of being outside looking in, we should take the visitor inside of the lithographs. Send them on a time travel adventure&mdash;give them context, a starting point, and let them drive the experience. To help bring this idea to life I co-wrote the story with the curator; performed interaction design; and conducted usability tests.
      </p>

      <h3 class="work-page__subheading">Storytelling</h3>
      <p>
        I led four team workshops to help create the story.
      </p>

        <li><h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Themes &amp; Groupings</h4>
        <p class="subheading__note">Workshop 1</p>
          <p>
            We referenced the lithographs to create an affinity diagram, which generated six categories based on geography and content:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><p>The Heart of Chicago</p></li>
              <li><p>The Commercial District</p></li>
              <li><p>Cultural Attractions</p></li>
              <li><p>Waterways</p></li>
              <li><p>Churches</p></li>
              <li><p>The South Side</p></li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Arc &amp; Framework</h4>
        <p class="subheading__note">Workshop 2</p>
          <p>We used the themes and groupings to create the story arc:</p>
          <p class="italic">
            You journey to 1860s Chicago via train, arriving at the Great Central Depot.  Your first destination is the Sherman House, a hotel that serves as the launch pad for your visit. Stepping outside of your hotel you find a map and tour guide offering visits to several attractions that Chicago has to offer.
          </p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="large-block-grid-2">
        <li><h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Surprise &amp; Delight</h4>
          <p class="subheading__note">Workshop 3</p>
          <p>
          I conducted an interview with the curator that revealed moments of surprise and delight in the form of curatorial trivia focused on specific and unique elements found within each lithograph.
          <span class="action">
            <a href="#" class="button small radius" ng-click="openSurprise()">View an example</a>
          </span>
          </p>

        </li>
        <li><h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Weaving the Narrative</h4>
        <p class="subheading__note">Workshop 4</p>
          <p>
            Finally, we used all of the previously generated story assets to write the narrative&mdash;which I used to create the user flow.
          </p>
        </li>
        </ul>

      <h3 class="work-page__subheading">Interaction Design</h3>
      <p>
        I created user-flow diagrams, lo-fi wireframes, and historically accurate map markers which we used to visualize the story.
