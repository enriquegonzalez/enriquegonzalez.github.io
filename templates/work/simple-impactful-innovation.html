        The Chicago History Museum has over two million photographs in its collection. Only a small sample of the collection is digitized, and before I started this project it was not publicly accessible. You had to physically visit the Museum's research center in order to navigate your way through some of the images. There were no resources for an online Digital Asset Management system; no money to buy one, and no one to create it. The images resonated with me, and I made it a personal goal to share them with the world.
      </p>

      <h3 class="work-page__subheading">My Role</h3>
      <p>
        As the Multimedia Designer for the Museum I was constantly working with great images. I wanted to delight people with these images and encourage them to regularly engage with history; I wanted to create the <span class="italic">National Geographic</span> of urban history.
      </p>
       <p>
        My idea was to use social media to exhibit the images to the public. Using social media channels provided us with a low-cost technical solution, which was publicly accessible, allowed us to ship fast, and we could leverage our existing platforms and audiences to promote this new initiative.
      </p>
      <p>
        To bring the idea to life I needed to partner with photo collection stakeholders; develop the strategy, execute it, and measure its impact&mdash;I had to own this.
      </p>

      <h3 class="work-page__subheading">Strategy &amp; Execution</h3>
      <p>
        I pitched my idea to my supervisor and received her blessings. My next step was selling this idea to the photo collection stakeholders: the director of collections, Rights and Reproductions team, and photolab staff.
      </p>
      <p>
        The director of collections was hesitant because one of the Museum's key businesses is the licensing and reproduction of these photographs, so preserving the image rights and license was a must.

        We sat with the Museum's legal advisor and reviewed the Terms of Service for five major social networks. In the end I received legal sign-off on Tumblr, and approval from the director of collections&mdash;so I created <span class="italic"><a href="http://chicagohistorymuseum.tumblr.com/" target="blank">Chicago&nbsp;History&nbsp;in&nbsp;Pictures</a></span>.

      <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Workflow</h4>
      <p>
        Creating the Tumblr theme was only the beginning, in order for this system to work I needed to establish a manageable workflow that guaranteed quality content for our audience without compromising the Museum's license, or eating up too many resources. I created the workflow below, and performed it on a monthly basis.
