        The Chicago History Museum has over two million photographs in its collection. Only a small sample of the collection is digitized, and before I started this project it was not publicly accessible. You had to physically visit the Museum’s research center in order to navigate your way through a small portion the images. There were no resources for an online Digital Asset Management system; no money to buy one, and no one to create it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">It is the Museum’s mission to share Chicago’s story.</span> The images resonated with me; I considered them to be among the Museum’s most compelling storytelling materials, so I made it a personal goal to help the Museum share them with the world.

        </header>
        <p>
          As the Multimedia Designer for the Museum I was constantly discovering its great images. I wanted to share the images, delight people with them, and hopefully use them to create a new wave of history enthusiasts; I wanted to create the <span class="italic">National Geographic</span> of urban history.
        </p>
         <p>
          My idea involved using social media to present the images to the public. Using social media provided us with a low-cost technical solution, it allowed us to ship fast, and enabled us to leverage our existing communities to promote this new initiative.
        </p>
        <p>
          To bring the idea to life I partnered with the photography collection stakeholders; developed the strategy, executed on it, and measured its impact.

        <h4 class="subhead subhead--medium">Get Buy-in</h4>
        <p>
          I pitched the idea to my supervisor and received her blessings. My next step was selling the idea to the photo collection stakeholders: the director of collections, the rights and reproductions team, and photolab staff.
        </p>
        <p>
          The director of collections was hesitant because one of the Museum’s key businesses is the licensing and reproduction of the photographs, so preserving the image rights and license was a must.
        </p>

          We met with the Museum’s legal advisor and reviewed the Terms of Service for five major social networks. In the end I received legal sign-off on Tumblr, and approval from the director of collections. That’s when I created the experiment: <span class="italic"><a href="http://chicagohistorymuseum.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Chicago&nbsp;History&nbsp;in&nbsp;Pictures</a></span>&mdash;a Tumblr photoblog.
        </p>
        <p>
          We would know if this experiment worked if our Tumblr followers grew at a steady rate, and if followers consistently liked or shared our images.

        <h4 class="subhead subhead--medium">Share Ownership &amp; Establish Workflow</h4>
        <p>
          Creating the Tumblr theme and photoblog was only the beginning. In order for this system to work I needed to establish a manageable workflow that guaranteed quality content for our audience without compromising the Museum’s license, or consuming too many resources. I shared ownership of the pilot with the rights and reproductions department and the photolab team. We created the workflow below, and performed this routine on a monthly basis.
