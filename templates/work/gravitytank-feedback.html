      <p>
        From May to August 2014, I worked with <a href="http://www.gravitytank.com/about">gravitytank</a> to reimagine their internal staff review experience. They presented me with a problem and a concept; 10 weeks later I gave them a user-centric high-fidelity web application prototype called <span class="italic">Feedback</span>, which they continue to use and evolve today.
      </p>

      <p>
        gravitytank's current review system did not provide the value expected by anyone involved in the review process. Innovation is gravitytank’s bread and butter, so they came up with a great idea on how to get the value they were looking for. Their idea was to do away with traditional performance reviews, and create a mechanism that empowers staff to declare their professional goals and receive the contextual feedback to help achieve them. The solution was creating the <span class="italic">Feedback</span> web application.
      </p>

        <h3 class="work-page__subheading">My Role</h3>
        <p>
          My role as interaction designer on this project involved three main responsibilities: objectivity, product ownership, and full-stack prototyping.
        </p>

      <ul class="large-block-grid-3">
        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Objectivity</h4>
          <p>
            gravitytank has the capabilities to design and engineer web applications. As users of the <span class="italic">Feedback</span> application, they felt that it would be a missed opportunity to not include an objective party in the early stages of product design. It was my role to think outside of gravitytank, and challenge their idea by finding and using multiple perspectives&mdash;including my own.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Product Ownership</h4>
          <p>
            I partnered with key stakeholders at gravitytank for guidance, but during my time on the project I owned <span class="italic">Feedback</span>. It was my responsibility to help define the core value of the application and interpret its vision. We defined the core value as: <span class="bold italic">enhancing the naturally occurring feedback between gravitytank staff</span>.

          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Full-Stack Prototyping</h4>
          <p>
            I shaped the feedback application by managing the design and development schedule, performing the design and development work, negotiating and prioritizing features, leading weekly team check-ins, and adjusting accordingly.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>


      <h3 class="work-page__subheading">Lean, Agile, &amp; Human-Centered</h3>
        <p>
          In order to deliver a complete product prototype in 10 weeks I applied lean UX principles, <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch09_Epicenter_Design.php">epicenter&nbsp;design</a>, rapid prototyping methods, and weekly development sprints.
        </p>

       <ul class="large-block-grid-3">
        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Get Smart</h4>
          <p class="subheading__note">3 weeks</p>
          <p>
            I performed formative research to learn about the application's users and it's ecosystem; planned my approach, the system, and schedule; and generated consensus with stakeholders for sign-off.
          </p>

          <h5 class="work-page__subheading--xsmall">Toolkit</h5>
          <p class="italic">
            HR documents; user interviews; Basecamp; user stories; sketches: user flows, scope diagrams, entity relationship models, and CRUD views; and closed card sorting for Information Architecture.

        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Build</h4>
          <p class="subheading__note">6 weeks</p>
          <p>I used artifacts generated in the <span class="italic">Get Smart</span> stage to produce key application features for the team to test, review, and discuss on a weekly basis.</p>

          <h5 class="work-page__subheading--xsmall">Toolkit</h5>
          <p class="italic">

        </li>
        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Deliver and Reflect</h4>
          <p class="subheading__note">1 week</p>
          <p>
            During the last week of the project I met regularly with the production team for general walk-throughs; to discuss pending product decisions; and to catch, document, and fix as many technical bugs as possible. I delivered the fully functional and value focused prototype and conduted the final check-in with stakeholders.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="work-page__subheading">Results</h3>
        <p>In the end I <span class="bold">exceeded stakeholder expectations</span>&mdash;they were delighted by my work and process; I <span class="bold">generated production team happiness</span>&mdash;they were able to take my prototype and immediately start evolving it with out technical difficulties; and <span class="bold">created a product</span>&mdash;the <span class="italic">Feedback</span> prototype is now a gravitytank product, which they continue to use and evolve today.
        </p>

        <h3 class="work-page__subheading">Challenges</h3>
        <p>I experienced three major challenges while working on <span class="italic">Feedback</span>: feature creep, earning trust, and complex authorization.
        </p>

        <ul class="large-block-grid-3">
        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Feature Creep</h4>
          <p>
            This is a constant in every project and defining the core value with stakeholders is essential for prevention. Using the core value statement as a guide helped me negotiate and prioritize features.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Earning trust</h4>
          <p>
            I implemented a lean design process to meet the short timeline of the project. To move the prototype forward at a fast rate I jumped from sketches to code, and gravitytank made that leap with me. I sensed tension in the team during that transition, and later learned that it could have been avoided by providing a couple of polished digital mockups of application views. When working with a new team this step should be clearly negotiated.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Complex authorization</h4>
          <p>
             Feedback, as I designed it, resembles a managed social network. It consists of multi-dimensional user relationships, which are determined by an admin, the user, the user’s context, the organization’s structure, and predetermined intervals. The app could not provide its core value without these rules in place, and I underestimated their complexity. If the application you’re building requires users to interact with each other, then design those rules early on and implement them as dependencies arise.
