        On May 15, 2014, I worked with <a href="http://www.gravitytank.com/about">gravitytank</a> to reimagine their internal staff review experience. They presented me with a problem and a concept. 10 weeks later I gave them a user-centric, functional, and high-fidelity prototype of a feedback system that they continue to evolve today.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subheading--page">The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        gravitytank's previous review system was a traditional one&mdash;Staff performs work and their superiors review their performance based on predefined institutional metrics. This wasnâ€™t working for anyone for a number of reasons:
      </p>

          <ol>
            <li>The review was one-directional</li>
            <li>The process broke away from the natural feedback flow formed by teams and other organizational relationships</li>
            <li>The results of the process produced little-to-no value</li>
            <li>The review tool was archaic in design and technology</li>
          </ol>

      <h3 class="subheading--page">My Role</h3>
      <p>
        Because innovation is gravitytank's bread and butter, they discovered a potential solution to their internal review problem. As users of the product they found themselves too close to the project, and needed an objective outsider to help validate their concept. I was the objective outsider.
