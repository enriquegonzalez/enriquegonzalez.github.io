      <p>
        From May to August 2014, I worked with <a href="http://www.gravitytank.com/about">gravitytank</a> to reimagine their internal staff review experience. They presented me with a problem and a concept; 10 weeks later I gave them a user-centric and high-fidelity web application prototype called <span class="italic">Feedback</span>, which they continue to evolve today.
      </p>

      <p>
        gravitytank's review system was a traditional one, and not providing the value expected by those involved in the review process. Innovation is gravitytankâ€™s bread and butter, so they came up with a great idea on how to get the value they were looking for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their idea was to do away with traditional performance reviews, and create a mechanism that empowers staff to declare their professional goals and receive the contextual feedback to help achieve them. The solution was creating the <span class="italic">Feedback</span> web application.
      </p>

        <h3 class="work-page__subheading">My Role</h3>
        <p>
          My role as interaction designer on this project involved three main responsibilities:
        </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Objectivity</li>
              <li>Product Ownership</li>
              <li>High-fidelity Prototyping</li>
            </ol>

      <ul class="large-block-grid-3">
        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Objectivity</h4>
          <p>
            gravitytank has the capabilities to design and engineer web applications. As users of the <span class="italic">Feedback</span> application, they felt that it would be a missed opportunity to not include an objective party in the early stages of product design. It was my role to think outside of gravitytank, and challenge their idea by finding and using multiple perspectives&mdash;including my own.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Product Ownership</h4>
          <p>
            I partnered with key stakeholders at gravitytank for guidance, but during my time on the project I owned <span class="italic">Feedback</span>. It was my responsibility to help define the core value of the application and interpret it's vision. We defined the core value as <span class="italic">enhancing the naturally occurring feedback between gravitytank staff</span>.

          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Full-Stack Prototyping</h4>
          <p>
            I shaped the feedback application by managing the design and development schedule, performing the design and development work, negotiating and prioritizing features, leading weekly team check-ins, and adjusting accordingly.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>


      <h3 class="work-page__subheading">Lean, Agile, &amp; Human-Centered</h3>
        <p>
          In order to deliver a complete product prototype in 10 weeks I applied lean UX principles, <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch09_Epicenter_Design.php">epicenter&nbsp;design</a>, rapid prototyping methods, and weekly development sprints.
        </p>

       <ul class="large-block-grid-3">
        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Get Smart</h4>
          <p class="subheading__note">3 weeks</p>
          <p>
            I performed formative research to learn about gravitytank staff, structure, and business; created a draft schedule; mapped my approach; mapped the system; and generated consensus with stakeholders.
          </p>

          <h5 class="work-page__subheading--xsmall">Toolkit</h5>
          <p class="italic">
            HR documents; user interviews; Basecamp; user stories; sketches: user flows, scope diagrams, entity relationship models, and CRUD views; and closed card sorting.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Sketch to Code</h4>
          <p class="subheading__note">6 weeks</p>
          <p>I used notes and sketches generated in the <span class="italic">Get Smart</span> stage to produce a key application feature for the team to test, review, and discuss.</p>

          <h5 class="work-page__subheading--xsmall">Toolkit</h5>
          <p class="italic">
            SCRUM board, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Devise, Bower, Foundation, HTML, CSS, AngularJS, GitHub, Heroku, and Google Sheets for bug tracking.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Deliver and Reflect</h4>
          <p class="subheading__note">1 week</p>
          <p>
            During the last week of the project I met regularly with the production team for general walk-through, to discuss pending product decisions, and to fix as many technical bugs as possible. My final check-in was with senior leadership in operations and interaction design. I asked them for brutally honest feedback and they gave it.
          </p>

      </ul>
