      <p>
        gravitytank believes in empowering their staff. They had an internal staff review system which wasn’t helping them do this, and wasn’t good fit for their environment. Innovation is gravitytank’s bread and butter, so they came up with a great idea on how to get the value they were looking for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their idea was to do away with the traditional review system, and create a mechanism that empowers staff to declare their professional goals and receive the contextual feedback to help achieve them. The experiment we performed to achieve this was creating the <span class="italic">Feedback</span> web application.
      </p>
      <p>
        From May to August 2014, I worked with <a href="http://www.gravitytank.com/about">gravitytank</a> to create the <span class="italic">Feedback</span> prototype. They presented me with the problem and a concept; 10 weeks later we had a functional user-centric high-fidelity prototype, which they continue to use and evolve today.
      </p>

        <h3 class="work-page__subheading">My Role</h3>
        <p>
          As interaction designer on this project I had three main responsibilities: objectivity, shared product ownership, and full-stack prototyping.
        </p>

      <ul class="large-block-grid-3">
        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Objectivity</h4>
          <p>
            gravitytank has the capabilities to design and engineer web applications. As users of the <span class="italic">Feedback</span> application, they felt a need to include an objective party in the early stages of product design. It was my role to think outside of gravitytank, and challenge their idea by finding and using multiple perspectives&mdash;including my own.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Shared Ownership</h4>
          <p>
            I partnered with key stakeholders at gravitytank for guidance, but during my time on the project I had to share ownership of <span class="italic">Feedback</span>. To share the ownership, it was my responsibility to build and maintain a shared understanding with the team. Some of the ways I achieved this was by helping to define the core value of the application and interpreting its vision. Together we defined the core value as: <span class="bold italic">enhancing the naturally occurring feedback between gravitytank staff</span>.

          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Full-Stack Prototyping</h4>
          <p>
            I shaped the feedback application by managing the design and development schedule, performing the design and development work, negotiating and prioritizing features, leading weekly team check-ins, and adjusting accordingly.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>


      <h3 class="work-page__subheading">Lean, Agile, &amp; Human-Centered</h3>
        <p>
          In order to deliver a complete product prototype in 10 weeks I applied the lean UX process, <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch09_Epicenter_Design.php">epicenter&nbsp;design</a>, rapid prototyping methods, and weekly development sprints. I broke up the project into three stages: Get Smart, Build &amp Deliver, and Refine &amp; Reflect.
        </p>

       <ul class="large-block-grid-3">
        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Get Smart</h4>
          <p class="subheading__note">3 weeks</p>
          <p>
            I planned my approach; performed formative research to learn about the application’s users and its ecosystem; partnered with engineers and designers to sketch the system architecture and build a shared understanding of the problem and experiement; drafted the project schedule; and finaly presented my plan, verified a shared understanding with the team and stakeholders, and received sign-off.

          <h5 class="work-page__subheading--xsmall">Toolkit</h5>
          <p class="italic">

        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Build &amp; Deliver</h4>
          <p class="subheading__note">6 weeks</p>
          <p>I used artifacts generated in the <span class="italic">Get Smart</span> stage to produce and ship key application features&mdash;on a weekly basis&mdash;for the team to review, discuss, test, and refine.</p>

          <h5 class="work-page__subheading--xsmall">Toolkit</h5>
          <p class="italic">
            SCRUM board, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Devise, Bower, Foundation, HTML, CSS, AngularJS, GitHub, Heroku, and Google Sheets for bug tracking.

        </li>
        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Refine &amp; Reflect</h4>
          <p class="subheading__note">1 week</p>
          <p>
            During the last week of the project I met regularly with the production team for general walkthroughs; to discuss pending product decisions; and to catch, document, and fix as many technical bugs as possible. At the end, the team assembled together for a final check-in to reflect on the work.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

        <h3 class="work-page__subheading">Challenges</h3>
        <p>I experienced three major challenges while working on <span class="italic">Feedback</span>: earning trust, complex authorization, and feature creep. Below are key takeaways:
        </p>

        <ul class="large-block-grid-3">
        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Earning trust</h4>
          <p>
            I implemented a lean design process to meet the short timeline of the project. To move the prototype forward at a fast rate I jumped from sketches to code, and gravitytank made that leap with me. I sensed tension in the team during that transition, and later learned that it could have been avoided by providing a couple of polished digital mockups of application views. When working with a new team this step should be clearly negotiated.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Complex authorization</h4>
          <p>
             <span class="italic">Feedback</span>, as I designed it, resembles a managed social network. It consists of multi-dimensional user relationships determined by an admin, the user, the user’s context, the organization’s structure, and predetermined intervals. The app could not provide its core value without these rules in place, and I underestimated their complexity.
         </p>
         <p>
            Thankfully, I had built a shared understanding of the system with engineers early on, and they were able to quickly guide me through this challenge. If the application you’re building requires users to interact with each other, then design those rules early on and implement them as dependencies arise.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4 class="work-page__subheading work-page__subheading--small">Feature Creep</h4>
          <p>
            This is a constant in every project and defining the core value with stakeholders is essential for prevention. Using the core value statement as a guide helped me negotiate and prioritize features.
          </p>
        </li>
        </ul>

      <h3 class="work-page__subheading">Results</h3>
        <p>In the end I <span class="bold">exceeded stakeholder expectations</span>&mdash;they were delighted by my work and process; I <span class="bold">generated production team happiness</span>&mdash;they were able to take my prototype and immediately start working on it with out technical difficulties; and <span class="bold">created a product</span>&mdash;the <span class="italic">Feedback</span> prototype is now a gravitytank product, which they continue to use and evolve today.
